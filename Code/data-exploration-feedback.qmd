## Data Exploration Feedback

1.  Line 48 - you can probably do a full_join to join these 2 dataframes together for later analysis. We can look at that together in class and make sure it is giving us what we want. The syntax is like this:

```{r}
test_df <- full_join(scount, sabund)
```

2.  Line 289 - "Looks good." I agree! You did a nice thorough job going over these data and I especially like that you made some predictions (example line 241 about richness) that show me that you were thinking about your data. Excellent!

Well done.
