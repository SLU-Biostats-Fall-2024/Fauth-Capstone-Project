    2022-07-11Salamanders are vital bioindicators that function to support a terrestrial forest
      ecosystem. The continuous loss of amphibian species and their habitat can have profound
      impacts on terrestrial systems. In terrestrial environments, salamanders use natural cover for
      refuge, foraging, and maintaining moisture; however, artificial cover has commonly been used
      to survey and conserve these species. The objective of this study was to assess terrestrial
      salamander preference for natural versus artificial coverboards in relation to forest stands
      in two successional stages located within the James H. Barrow Biological Field Station (Hiram,
      Ohio). Ten artificial (particle board, 30 x 33 cm) and ten natural (white ash, 30 x 30 cm)
      coverboards were placed in two 50 m parallel transects arranged 2 m apart within transitional
      and mature forests. Surveys were conducted weekly between the second week of September and the
      second week of November from 2018 to 2021. Average weakly precipitation and max temperature
      were recorded. Both abundance and species richness were significantly higher under natural
      coverboards and in the transitional forest. There were also correlation between species
      richness and abundance with daily max temperature and weakly precipitation. 678 individuals
      across five species were found: Eastern Red-Backed Salamander, Spotted Salamander, Four-Toed
      Salamander, Red-Spotted Newt, and Northern Two-Lined Salamander. Eastern Red-Backed
      Salamanders were the most abundant species within both mature and transitional forests.
      Natural coverboards may be a better method to survey terrestrial salamanders because
      artificial coverboards are comprised of wood chippings, wax and adhesives which may alter soil
      permeability for less favorable conditions.

        Salamander Survey Methods - Each site contains ten artificial made (particle
          board, 30 x 33 cm) coverboards paired off with ten natural (white ash, ~30 x 30 cm)
          coverboards. The artificial coverboards are 2 cm thick and the natural coverboards range
          from 2-5 cm in thickness. We placed boards in the forest in July 2018, one board of each
          treatment at a 2 m apart and separating each pair by 5 m along a 50 m transect. We
          randomly assigned the order of artificial or natural coverboards for each pair. In 2018,
          2019, 2020, and 2021, sampling took place between the second week of September and the
          second week of November, occurring once per week between 1200 hr and 1500 hr. All
          measurements were recorded during calm wind (0-12 kmh) and above freezing temperature
          (0°C-30°C). During each sampling session, we flipped the coverboards and recorded
          salamander species and snout-vent length. When recording snout to vent length, salamanders
          were placed in a quart sized plastic clear bag with water to minimize skin damage and
          distress. Once the salamanders were recorded, they would be placed back under the
          coverboard where they were found.

      cleaned_salamander_data
      cleaned_salamander_data.csv contains measurements from salamanders found from weekly sampling of cover boards in the James H. Barrow Field Station during the Fall 12-week session session from 2018 to 2021.  Precipitation and Temperature data was added after-the-fact by downloading daily summary weather data from NOAA Climate Data Online Search (https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cdo-web/search) for the station id "USC00333780" in Hiram, OH, which is within 2 miles of the field station.  The Weekly Precipitation was calculated by adding the daily precipitations for the day when sampling occurred plus the 6 days prior.
