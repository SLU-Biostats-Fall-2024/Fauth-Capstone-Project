# Fauth-Capstone-Project

There are two data files each including mostly the same data except one includes the occupancy data and the other includes the species richness and abundance.

The Fauth_cleaned_salamanderdata.csv includes the variables Species and Count, whereas Fauth_salamander_richness_abundace.csv replaces these variables with Abundance and Richness. Otherwise all the other variables are the same.
